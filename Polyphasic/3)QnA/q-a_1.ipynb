    "# **Question Answering❓**\n",
    "with fine-tuned BERT on newsQA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Question answering comes in many forms. We’ll look at the particular type of extractive QA that involves answering a question about a passage by highlighting the segment of the passage that answers the question. This involves fine-tuning a model which predicts a start position and an end position in the passage. More specifically, we will fine tune the [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) model on the [NewsQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lucadiliello/newsqa) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
